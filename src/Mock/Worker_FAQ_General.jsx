    answer:
      "StepCoders.com allows you to cash in on your areas of expertise and interest. Unlike traditional contracting, we guarantee payment so you can stop worrying about billing and collections, and focus on what you do best. The site can automatically notify you of new projects as they come in, and then you can bid on the ones you're interested in. After the employer accepts your bid, they escrow the funds to prove 'they are good for the money'. Once you complete the work, you're awarded the funds from escrow. That's all there is to it.",
